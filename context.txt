Remote Procedure Call (RPC) - allows for abstraction of calling another computer's procedure
as if it were a local one with all of the transmission and communication taken care of
Main job of RPC: take arguments, package them and send them to other computer.
When it gets a response, it has to unpackage it and pass it back.

The client and server will each have a stub implemented by RPC to communicate with each other over a network
